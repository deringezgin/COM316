Scheme Programming Assignment #3

Copy the five files that I wrote to show a 2D search (they are provided on
the Programming Assignments web page). Modify the program so that it
marks visited nodes (squares) as visited. Then modify the program so that
it will choose a free node over a visited if it has a choice. For both
of these modifications you only need to change/add-to grid-search.ss.
Although changing the value of pause-num in grid-main.ss will help
you see what's going on by reducing the speed. Try changing other values
in this file to see the effects. Run the original program and your
modified program each 10 times. Does your modification improve the
steps taken to find the goal?
