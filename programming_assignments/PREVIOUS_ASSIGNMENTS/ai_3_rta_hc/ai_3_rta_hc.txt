AI #3:Implement RTA* or Hill-Climbing (max score of 80) search. Your program is due before class 24 Sep. It is a little difficult to implement RTA*. The best method is to use what we described in class with a branch and bound g(n) search (same as BFS in our case). Whatever method you use, make sure your program counts the number of steps taken. For extra credit do both methods with some means of comparison, such as have them each solve the same graph. Run them for 10 different graphs and save the average search steps. Also read the assigned reading (Genetic Algorithms for the Development of Real-Time Multi-Heuristic Search Strategies) for class on 24 Sep. Don't forget to answer the standard questions.
