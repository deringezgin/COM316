Program 9  Perceptron Learning

Part 1: Copy perceptron.ss and perceptron-input.  The program contains a single 
perceptron that uses a sigmoid function to determine output and the delta rule 
to do learning. The file perceptron-input defines a training set to learn OR.  
Try it out over 1000 training generations.  Write a training list for AND and 
attempt one for XOR.  If you can't get XOR, explain what might be the problem.

Part 2: Go back to doing OR.  Change epsilon, the learning rate to 10, 100, and 1000.
What do you observe and why?

Part 3: Write a training set (perceptron-input file) to learn passability based on 
2 continuous inputs (stability and height).  Let's assume to be passable the stability 
needs to be greater than .9 and the height needs to be less than .5.  How does it do
learning the concept?  Explain.  

Part 4: Discuss how NNs with learning can be used to help us in our search problem.


Do the 3q for NNs.
