AI #4b: Implement a Game Playing program using Monte Carlo Tree Search with you being the goal or the robot (as assigned in class), with the robot chasing the goal. Your program is due at 9am Thaursday, 17 Oct.
We will have a little competition during class on 17 Oct. In addition to submitting your solution, email either your MiniMax or MonteCarlo solution to Jim and cc me. You are to email a single file. Name it either yourname-robot.ss or yourname-goal.ss. For the competition, we'll use a max of 5 seconds per move whether you are using MiniMax or Monte Carlo. The program should work well in a variety of different obstacle densities. The grid will probably be 20x20 or 30x30. Make sure that all of your functions are unique. If you are the robot, put robot- or r- at the front of each new function name. If you are the goal, put goal- or g- at the front of each new function name.
For extra credit, you can do programs for both the robot and the goal.
