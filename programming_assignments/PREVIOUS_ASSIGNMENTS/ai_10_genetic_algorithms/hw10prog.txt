AI #10 is due 26 Nov.

Copy GAcode.ss. This is a genetic algorithm (GA) that learns a set of integers -- almost.
It still needs GAevaluate-ind completed in GAcode-helper.ss. Write three of these.

One that learns to have all of the integers as large as possible.
A second that learns to have all of the integers equally divisible by 10 (mod 10 = 0).
The third should learn any set of integers that you specify -- you can have a global variable called int-target-list or something.

You only need to modify GAcode-helper.ss for all of these.

Read Chapter One of An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms by Melanie Mitchell and Using a Genetic Algorithm to Replicate
Allopatric Speciation by Parker and Edwards.

No 3q are due.
