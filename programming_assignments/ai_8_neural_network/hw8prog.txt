Program 8  Feed-Forward Neural Networks

Intro:  Connectionist networks are computational systems that use a set of connecting
artificial neurons to do the computation.  Feed-Forward Neural Networks (NN) are one
type of connectionist network.  Flow goes only from input to output neurons through
any number of internal (hidden) layers.  

Part1:  Copy NN0.ss.  This Neural Network uses a step function to determine output.  
Try each of the threshold-weights already defined.  Run:
(NN '(0 0))
(NN '(0 1))
(NN '(1 0))
(NN '(1 1))
What are each of the functions 
("and", "or", "xor", or "not xor")?  Write two additional threshold-weights to represent 
the other two logic functions.

Part2:  Write NN1.ss.  This Neural Network uses a sigmoid function to determine output. 
All you need to do is change the function g to make it a sigmond instead of a step 
function (you can use the Scheme function exp instead of expt).  Try the first set of 
threshold-weights already defined.  What is the function ("and", "or", or "xor")?  
Modify it so that the trues (above .5) are not so close to the falses (below .5).  
In other words, true should be closer to 1 and false closer to 0. Write two additional 
threshold-weights to represent the other two logic functions.

Part3: Discuss how NNs can be used to help us in our search problem.
