Problem 8 Semantic Networks

Intro: Problem 6 used predicate calculus with predicate
representations to deal with the objects of the world.  Now we want to
expand that to help our ability to reason.  What if we had categories
of objects that we could reason with?  Say we had different types of
obstacles some that we could walk over, others that we couldn't.  For
example, we could have boxes, crates, poles, chairs, tables, rocks,
buildings, etc.  These could be categorized such as chairs and tables
are both furniture-items.  And we could go on to say that if it is a
furniture-item then one could step on it to get past.  Now we can
write a general rule using furniture-item instead of two rules, one
for chairs and one for tables.

Given:
1.  Same as Problem 6.
2.  A more complicated world with differing obstacles.
3.  isa links that link objects to their category: (isa chair
furniture-item).

Problem: Using a graphical representation with nodes as objects and
edges as links create a hierarchical structure with block at the top.
clear and obstacle will have one way isa links to block.  Make up
reasonable objects to be obstacles that can fit into the hierarchy.
Add additional links to describe the objects.  Now graphically
represent some portion of our 2d grid (2x2 blocks should suffice) that
makes use of the new hierarchy.
