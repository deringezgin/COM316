Problem 6 First Order Logic

Intro:  Representation is still not general enough.  We can
only represent true or false in each proposition.  In addition,
we need to write a rule for each possible case.  It would be 
better if we could generalize the representation.

Given:  Same as problem 2.

Problem:  Create a representation that is more general and can
hold more information than just yes or no.  For example; a 
represention where we can have heights of low, medium, and high.  
Also discuss how this system would reason. How would it do Modus 
Ponens?
