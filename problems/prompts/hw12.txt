Scripts

From the previous assignment:
Here is a new thematic-role frame issue we need to deal with.
Let's say that we told someone:
"Joe went to McDonalds.  He left feeling satisfied with his meal."
If we ask them:
"Did he eat?" 
They would say yes (or at least that the statement implies that they ate).
If we asked them:
"How did he get his food?"
They could probably answer this also without a problem.
Now, what if we went through the same sequence with a computer?
It probably couldn't answer correctly, even if we used our spiffy thematic-role 
frames to represent the questions.

Scripts using conceptual dependancies were developed to deal with this issue.  
Conceptual dependancies were covered in class today.  Please recall:
PTRANS
ATRANS
MTRANS
MBUILD
ATTEND
GRASP
PROPEL
MOVE
INGEST
EXPEL
SPEAK 

Scripts are special types of frames that describe the common knowledge 
information that people know about certain situations.  A script is made 
up of several parts.  For example, the restaurant script for a standard
sit down and order restaurant will have these sections:

props
roles
entry conditions
results 
scenes

Possible fillers for these would include:

props: tables, chairs,
roles: customer, cook, 
entry conditions: customer is hungry,
results: customer is not hungry,
scenes: entering, ordering,

Add other fillers as appropriate.

Each of the scenes is an ordered list (possibly with branches) of events.
To complete our script, we will need to develop these lists for all of the
scenes of the script.  In my script, I have 4 scenes.  For this homework, 
add any needed fillers to the slots as appropriate and for each scene, 
develop an event list for the scene (3 to 6 events each).

I'll start scene1

entering
  customer PTRANS customer into restaurant 
  customer ATTEND eyes to tables
  customer MBUILD where to sit
  I have 2 more

Note in case this was not clear: One uses PTRANS if moving whole person. 
MOVE is if moving an arm or changing position, such as from standing to sitting.


Reasoning from Past Examples

We need a way to reason without specific knowledge about the situation.  If a
human came to an obstacle that was a wooden box but not a crate and he knew a crate 
was a passable obstacle he would step on the wooden box.  He would draw an analogy
between the wooden box and the crate and realize that if one is passable, the other
probably is too.  With our current system, the robot would only consider the wooden
box as passable if it was specifically designated to do so in the given rules. 
Suggest and explain a method to deal with this. 
How would you expand your method to include learning?

Note: This question is not specifically associated with thematic-role frames, 
but could be with frames in general.  In addition, it is not the inductive 
learning we did in the last HW.  As we discussed, inductive learning required 
several examples and near misses to make the concept more specific.  In
addition, if the robot came upon something not matching the concept, it
had no idea as to whether it is passable or not.
