A. Planning

Use the STRIPS planning approach to make a plan to solve the blocks
problem given below.  The set of facts that describes an initial
condition and the set of facts that describes a goal condition are
provided.  In your solution you should describe how you handled
all links including when they were generated.  In addition, discuss 
how things might change if the ordering of the preconditions of the 
rules changed.  Your answers show be both specific to the problem 
given and general enough to handle any initial/goal situation.  For 
extra credit, write a pseudocode algorithm that shows how the 
planner works.

B. Current-Best Learning 

Describe how the robot can use learning through induction
and the semantic representation of an object to learn important
concepts that will help in its search.  The primary concept that is
needed for search as we do it now, is passability.  We have several
possible objects that can be obstacles (chairs, desks, book shelves,
buildings, monsters, kittens, etc.).  We need the robot to learn the
concept of passability.  Initially think of this as you showing the
robot objects and telling it whether they are passable or not.  What
objects would you use and in what order?  What will change about the
robot's concept of passable with each example?  Show an example of a
learning session. Draw each new object shown to the robot along with
its semantic net representation and the new semantic net representing
the concept of a passable object.  Once trained, would it be able to
sense the attributes of some new obstacle and determine if it is
passable?  How useful is this for the robot's ability to search in our
more complicated environment?

Assuming that the robot is capable of attempting to move into any
block, but that unpassable blocks hurt (make the robot lose E points
or something), can the robot use inductive learning without the help
of an instructor?  How would this system work in our search problem?


C. Representation

Although we have some more organization with semantic 
networks, we still have a scattering of links.  Objects and classes 
of objects can be linked by relationship links -- we can designate
an object as Chair5 with an isa link to wheeled-chairs and a color
link to red.  But what if there was no color link or even a default
color link in the hierarchy?  How would we know there was even the 
possibility of color for a chair?  Another issue is that it's a
problem to represent information that is not discrete. More 
structure in our organization would help us use the isa links for 
inheritance and possibly make it easier for data to be continuous.  
Suggest some possibilities for this more structured method of 
representation.
