Problem 4  Game Playing

Intro:  Now we will add an opponent who can move the goal a step every
time you move.  

Given:
1.  Same as Problem 3.
2. Except that we are back to knowing the entire grid.  In other words,
we know the location of every obstacle on the grid.  We also know the 
current location of the goal.
3.  A function (move-goal C G) that takes in the current block of the
robot and the position of the goal and returns the new position of the
goal.  This function will stochastically choose which way to go with the
highest probability being away from the robot.  Your solution should not
make use of this information but should just assume the goal mover is an
opponent intending on getting away.
4. Assume the robot moves and then the goal moves and they continue to 
alternate.  Both the robot and goal have the option to stay in place.
5. The goal is considered captured as soon as the robot is in an 
adjacent space.


Problem:  Using what you know about search and the tree representation of 
it, come up with a way for the robot to find the goal.  As always, 
efficiency is of importance.

Note: The point of this problem is for you to find a way to deal with an
opponent.  You can be the robot as stated above, with the goal the 
opponent.  Or if you prefer to do the problem from the other perspective,
you can be the goal, with the robot as the opponent. The function above 
will be (move-robot C G).  In either case, you and the opponent are going 
the same speed.  The opponent is trying to win (stay away from you if it 
is the goal; catch you if it is the robot) and you are also trying to win.  
The one who will win is the one that is smarter (and/or often luckier).
