Cased Based Reasoning (CBR)

Same Intro:  
We need a way to reason without specific knowledge about the situation.  If a
human came to an obstacle that was a wooden box but not a crate and he knew a crate
was a passable obstacle he would step on the wooden box.  He would draw an analogy
between the wooden box and the crate and realize that if one is passable, the other
probably is too.  With our current system, the robot would only consider the wooden
box as passable if it were specifically designated to do so in the given rules.  

New Stuff:
What we need is a system of case based reasoning that can recognize the similarity, 
alter the specified action accordingly (to compensate for the differences) and after 
taking this action, record the case and results for future reference.  This is CBR.  
In addition CBR usually uses an indexing scheme to speed search for a match when the
data base is large.  This can be done in several ways; the central idea is to reduce
what is being matched to what is the most important.  This can significantly narrow
the field of possible matches allowing a more detailed look of the remaining
contestants.

Given:
1.  Same as Problem 9 with possible additional characteristics for each object.
2.  Additional objects of the student's choice to show their CBR system.

Problem:  
Create a CBR system that can reason about the passableness of objects that it has 
never seen.  New objects encountered should be added to the data base to allow
their use in future reasoning.  New objects should have a full description of
characteristics except for their passableness, which is what the CBR will determine.
Use at least 2 objects stored in the database and the description of a new object to
explain how your system works.

How would you use indexes to improve this systems performance if it had several more
objects in the data base?

Consider also a CBR system that does not make a separate determination for
passableness; it uses what it knows about it's current state and a database of past
states to determine it's next move. 

Address the issues concerned with retrieval, adaptation, and evaluation for each of
the methods you describe.
