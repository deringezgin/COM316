Problem 3  Real-Time Search

Intro:  If we were programming a robot with limited sensor range, we could
not assume that it could find the best path first and then follow it.  It
needs to explore as it finds the best path.

Given:
1. Same as Problem 2, except you can only check the status of nodes 
adjacent to the robot.
2. Now we need to keep track of the number of steps taken.  The robot
starts at the start spot and each move to a new frontier block costs the
number of steps it takes.

Problem:  Find an efficient way to get from the start to the goal.  We can
no longer expect to find the best way, but need to find a good way while
minimizing our steps taken.
