Problem 2 Heuristic Search

Intro:  The search in Problem 1 lacked direction.  If we had some way of
determining the goodness of our possible choices, we could better decide
which one to try first.

Given:
1. Same as Problem 1.
2. A function (h B C), which returns the goodness of block B in regards
to reaching block C.  This function is called a heuristic.  You may define
this function in any way you like as long as it does not use any other
information than the positions of the two blocks.
3. The x,y position of the goal.

Problem:  Find a more efficient way than used in Problem 1 to find a path
from the start to goal.  Have it find the shortest path or discuss ideas
of how this could be done.
