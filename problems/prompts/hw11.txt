Thematic-Role Frames

A few notes on thematic-role frames: 
1. The idea is to have a way to represent sentences so that a computer
program can understand.  Thematic-role frames describe actions conveyed
by the verbs and nouns in a sentence.
2. There are two types of frame: action and state-change.
3. There are also links, such as subaction (action within the main
action, but not a result of it) and results (result of an action (could
be another action or a state-change)), that link frames to frames.  I
also add desired-result as a link.
4. The thematic roles are roles being played in the theme.
5. The slots of each frame are the verb, identifying the action, and a
number of objects that play roles in the execution of the verb.
6. Each action frame, in general, has the following slots: verb, agent,
coagent, beneficiary, object, instrument, source, destination, old
surroundings, new surroundings, conveyance, trajectory, time, location,
and duration.  Not all are used for each action.  And some actions may
require others.
7. In addition, the frame has slots for links to link it to another
frame.  It can have one or more subaction and result link slots.
8. We can help make our thematic-role frames simpler for the computer to
understand by using primitives for the verbs -- a single word would
represent the ideas of hit and strike.  Examples would be speak, strike,
ingest, move-object, and move-possession.
9. State-change frames have an object, which is what is being changed. 

Problem One:
Redo the sentences from the previous HW using thematic-role frames as 
described in class.  Represent the following sentences in thematic-role 
frames:
Suzie told Robbie to put the wedge on the red block.
Robbie was unhappy because of the poor grade he received on a test.
Joe moved the car to the garage.
Suzie hit Robbie, which made him sad.

Problem Two:
Here is a new thematic-role frame issue we need to deal with.
Let's say that we told someone:
"Joe went to McDonalds.  He left feeling satisfied with his meal."
If we ask them:
"Did he eat?" 
They would say yes (or at least that the statement implies that they ate).
If we asked them:
"How did he get his food?"
They could probably answer this also without a problem.
Now, what if we went through the same sequence with a computer?
It probably couldn't answer correctly, even if we used our spiffy thematic-role 
frames to represent the questions.
Suggest and explain a method to deal with this.


Problem Three: Version Space Learning
Now we can use version space learning to help us learn the concept of 
passability.
Show the steps that would take place while using version-space learning on
this problem.  Here are the input examples (yes under passable indicates
that the block is passable):

Number  Width       Heigth      Color      Wheels        Passable
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1       wide        low         green      no wheels     yes
2       narrow      low         red        wheels        no
3       wide        low         yellow     no wheels     yes
4       narrow      high        green      no wheels     no
5       wide        high        blue       no wheels     no
6       wide        low         blue       wheels        no
7       narrow      low         green      no wheels     no
