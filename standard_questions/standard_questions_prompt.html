<h1 align="CENTER">COM316: Questions</h1>

            <p>
The answers (should be typed) to the following questions are due at the start of class on
the day specified (usually a week after the original problem was introduced). You should think about these and then discuss them in groups of four to five students. These are NOT to be handed in individually, unless you disagree with your group. They will be discussed during class.
<br><br>
1.  What other types of problems can we solve using this method?  In other
words, the problem probably deals with a very specific situation.  Can we
categorize what general category of problems this method can solve?<br><br>
2.  Assuming that this solution does not give us a fully autonomous
artificial mind, what is holding us back?<br><br>
3.  Can we restate this problem and/or add more tools to gain more ground
in our search for the artificial mind?  What small change will force us to
develop a solution that is one step closer to a fully autonomous
artificial mind?<br><br>
In addition to the answers to these questions, include the names of those who participated in the discussion and the date/time and the duration of the meeting. Depending on the problem being discussed, the duration should be 30 minutes to an hour.
