Hi Jim!
Hope everything is going well.
In this submission the file structure is a bit changed, so I want to write a note to summarise it.

"grid-RTA.ss" --> This file has the Real-Time A* Search
"grid-HC.ss" --> This file has the Hill Climber Search
"grid-main.ss" --> I modified the old main
"grid-boss.ss" --> Boss of everything:). It calls

So please run "grid-boss.ss" rather than "grid-main.ss". Otherwise, you'll only see 1 test case and no average.

I wanted to clarify it. Best,

Derin
