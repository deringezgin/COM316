  <b><font size="4">Course Description:
</font></b><blockquote> 
This course uses the incremental
learning of solutions for progressively harder problems to cover a
breadth of concepts used by researchers in their attempt to develop an
artificial mind.  General areas covered include search techniques,
propositional and first order logic, representation, production systems,
planning, learning, and connectionist systems (neural networks).
</blockquote><br>
 <b><font size="4">Discussion:</font> 
</b><blockquote>
<p>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) deals with a vast array of subjects that are
often seemingly unrelated.  Going from formal logic systems, to vision
processing, to planning, to robotics, to artificial neural networks; it
covers several well developed areas of study.  The central idea of all
these is the emulation of a living creature.  Not necessarily a model of
one that exists on earth, but one that has the characteristics of a living
creature; perception, movement, learning, reasoning and interaction.  One
or all of these can be incorporated in a study of AI.  Although all these
areas are important for the formation of an artificial creature, in this
course we will concentrate on the areas that are directly involved in the
creation of an artificial mind.  This has been the central theme of AI,
hence the name.  We will try to cover the breadth of this area to give the
student a good overview of research done.
</p><p>
	Drawing an analogy between "ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny" and
what we call the "AI skills development recapitulates the history of mind
design" we will cover areas of AI dealing with mind design by tending to
follow its history.  This should take us step by step through the
evolution of concepts appropriate to create an actual artificial mind.
We will learn progressively more complete systems, always striving for the
final yet still unreached goal of an artificial human brain.  The way the
student should approach this course is to consider what is needed to make
each step and what is the key element that limits each step.
</p><p>
	The idea of this course is for us to reason through intermediate
steps on the way to an artificial mind.  We will somewhat follow the
history of AI to help guide us and keep us in unison as we progress toward
an artificial mind.  The accuracy of our portrayal of history will not be
as important as its use in our learning of the concepts of AI, but some
idea of history's general trend will be a natural artifact of our
learning.
</p><p>
	The typical Tuesday class will start with discussions of 
solutions to the last programming assignment, the reading, and the 
three questions (listed below and on the main web page).  We will then introduce the
next step in our progression to an artificial mind.  A problem will be
introduced that is beyond our current capabilities to handle.  
Questions will be answered to ensure all understand the problem.  
During the Thursday class meeting student solutions will be handed in and
discussed.  Students may work in groups of no more than three to come 
up with their
solutions.  No outside sources should be used, only the tools and
background knowledge provided by the instructor. This HW should
take approximately 2-3 hours of thinking and
15-20 minutes to type the answer.  Do not do your thinking at a desk; do
it while you play soccer, eat, or go to a party.  It is more important
to have a good answer that you can defend, than a correct answer.  
</p><p>
The Thursday class will start with a discussion of student solutions.
Each student should be prepared to defend what they came up with. We will
discuss the standard solution and reading material will be distributed. 
The next phase will be the implementation of the standard solution;
although students who can convince the instructor that their solution is
as good as or better than the standard will be allowed to implement it. 
Students
will be provided with program segments written in scheme that will provide
the base for solving the problem and make the general problem concrete.
Questions will be answered to ensure all understand the use of support 
programs.   
</p><p>
For each problem give your solution and answer these three
questions:<br>
1.  What other types of problems can we solve using this method?  In other
words, the problem probably deals with a very specific situation.  Can we
categorize what general category of problems this method can solve?<br>
2.  Assuming that this solution does not give us a fully autonomous
artificial mind, what is holding us back?<br>
3.  Can we restate this problem and/or add more tools to gain more ground
in our search for the artificial mind?  What small change will force us to
develop a solution that is one step closer to a fully autonomous
artificial mind?<br>

 <b></b><blockquote><b>Problem Solutions:</b> Normally due each Thursday.  
These can be done in groups of no
more than three.   Using outside resources is not allowed. 
</blockquote>
<b></b><blockquote><b>Answers to Questions:</b> Normally due each week. 
These are to be done using no outside resources.  You should think about these
and then discuss them in groups of four to six students.  These are NOT to be 
handed in individually, unless you disagree with your group.
</blockquote>
<b></b><blockquote><b>Class Participation / Reading Discussion:</b>  A large part of the
learning experience will come from discussion of problems
presented in class and from the homework.  
In addition, all students are required
to do the readings and should be prepared to discuss them.
The participation grade will be determined by the quality of your participation in the problem and reading discussions.  
The best way to get the maximum points is to come to every class ready to present/defend your ideas from the homework and/or reading due that day. Good ways to reduce your participation grade include skipping class, consistently coming late, causing distractions, and not paying attention.  
</blockquote>
<b></b><blockquote><b>Programming Assignments:</b> There will be AI programming
assignments normally due every week.  Scheme programming assignments will be due at 
every class for a few weeks.  You need to do the Scheme programming assignments 
individually. You may work in teams of no more than three on the AI programming assignments. </blockquote>
<b></b><blockquote><b>AI Notebook:</b> This notebook is for you to organize and summarize what you have learned 
about AI.  It is to have an entry for each topic that we cover. Two paragraphs (one that summarizes the paper and a second that discusses your thoughts or opinions about the paper) about each of the assigned readings and if no paper was assigned a summary paragraph about the topic.
These are to be done individually and submitted via email by the last day of finals.

<b>Office Hours</b>
Office hours provide students with additional opportunities to review or ask questions about the class discussions and assignments. Connecticut College faculty encourage students to go to office hours so they might learn about your interests, both inside and outside the classroom. In addition to talking about class material and assignments, you may find you share common interests, such as music, books, hobbies, and movies. If a professor knows your interest, they may inform you about campus programs and activities or other opportunities like fellowships and scholarships. Most importantly, a professor who knows their students writes better letters of recommendation. Successful students at Connecticut College make time to go to their professor's office hours. All Connecticut College faculty are required to have office hours on their syllabus and posted on their office door.  If you cannot make your professor's scheduled office hours, contact your professor to set up an appointment.
